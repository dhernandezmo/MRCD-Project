```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

These data are recorded on a Tecator Infratec Food and Feed Analyzer 
working in the wavelength range 850 - 1050 nm by the Near Infrared 
Transmission (NIT) principle. Each sample contains finely chopped pure 
meat with different moisture, fat and protein contents.
  
  
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
